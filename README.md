# CCC2024Senior
The Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) is a yearly competition that tests students' understanding of coding languages and algorithms. The contest is split into two groups, the junior division and the senior division, which each includes five questions of increasing difficulty.

These files are the different pieces of code I submitted and to The 2024 Canadian Computing Competition Senior Division. I submitted files for questions S1, S2, and S3. The S3Clean file just cleans up all the unnecessary lines and commented codes. All three pieces of code passed submission with full marks.
