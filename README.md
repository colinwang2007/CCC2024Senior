# CCC2024Senior
The Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) is a yearly competition that tests students' understanding of coding languages and algorithms. The contest is split into two groups, the junior division and the senior division, which each includes five questions of increasing difficulty.

These files are the different pieces of code I submitted and to The 2024 Canadian Computing Competition Senior Division. I submitted files for questions S1, S2, S3, and S5. The S3Clean file just cleans up all the unnecessary lines and commented codes. My pieces of code for question S1, S2, and S3 submitted with full marks. My code for question S5 is incomplete and wasn't created with the intention of completing the question, but rather to steal two marks from the first test case batch.
